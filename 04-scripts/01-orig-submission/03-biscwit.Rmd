# BISCWIT{#biscwit}  

The Best Items Scale that is Cross-validated, Correlation-weighted, Informative and Transparent (BISCWIT) is a correlation-based machine learning technique. The technique, which we modified to be compatible with rolling origin validation rather than k-fold cross validation as implemented in the `best.scales()` function in the `psych` package in `R`, proceeds as follows. First, pairwise correlations between predictors and outcome(s) are calculated using rolling origin forecast validation where the number of best items is varied. Second, the number of items in the final model is determined by finding the average correlation across the rolling origin training sets with the validation sets for each number of items and choosing the one with the highest average correlation. Third, the final training model is constructed by running the procedure on the full training set with the number of items determined by the validation procedure. Fourth, weighted sum scores of the features for both the training and test sets are extracted.  

Finally, accuracy and AUC are calculated. Accuracy was estimated by (1) scaling the scores in the test set by the mean and standard deviation of scores in the final training model, (2) multiplying the scaled scores by the correlation between the training scores and the training outcome and the standard deviation of the training outcome and adding the mean of the training data outcome to this. This resulted in predicted outcomes for the test set. As in other classification models, values of .5 and above were considered to predict a “1” while values less than .5 were considered to predict a “0.” Accuracy was determined by comparing the predicted value with the actual test value and averaging the number correct. AUC was calculated using the predicted values and the test set values for the outcome.  

In the present study, we will use the `bestScales()` function from the psych package to create the models. Weighted scores were calculated by extracting the correlations from the best scales object and using it in the `scoreWtd()` function to create the correlation weighted scores. AUC was calculated using the `vi()` function in the vip package. Variable importance was determined by the items with the highest correlation with the outcome in the final training model.
