# Random Forest  

Random forest models are a variant of decision tree classification algorithms that additionally draw on bagging (i.e. ensemble methods; bootstrapping with aggregation) methods. The name itself hints at how it different from classic decision trees; we have a forest instead of a tree. In so doing, random forest models draw upon a large number of decision trees of varying depth that are then aggregated. The random part comes from two sources. First, each tree in the forest in trained on a data set drawn with replacement from the training dataset (i.e. bootstrapped) as part of the bagging procedure. Observations left out of each model are termed out-of-bag observations (and collectively, the out-of-bag dataset). These are used to evaluate the performance of the tree. Second, the features used in each tree are also randomly drawn from the full of features. Each of these trees, based on their data generates a prediction given new data. The final prediction is based off the ensemble of trees – that is, the decision made by a majority of the trees (i.e. aggregation). Importantly, because of the random feature selection part of the procedure, random forest can also provide estimates of variable importance, indicating which features are critical to making a less error-prone classification.  

Because random forest using bagging (i.e. bootstrapping with aggregation), we will have to perform a series of steps that make bootstrapping appropriate with time series data: differencing, Box-Cox transformations, and time-delay embedding. Essentially, differencing and Box-Cox transformations stabilize the mean and variance, respectively, to make the time series stationary (Priestley, 1988), and time-delay embedding quite literally embeds the sequence of the time series into predictor variables, which in effect preserves the order of the times series (Von Oertzen & Boker, 2010). We can easily back transform forecasts to their original scale.  

In the present study, we used the `tidymodels` package in R to estimate the random forest models by calling the `rand_forest()`, setting the engine as `“ranger”`, with `importance = “permutation”` in order to extract variable importance, and the mode as `“classification”`. The parameters tuned via rolling origin forecast validation were `mtry` (i.e. the number of predictors that will be randomly sampled at each split when creating tree models) and `min_n` (i.e. the minimum number of data points in a node that is required for the node to be split further), which were each set to 10 values. Next, we used the `select_best()` function with the `method` set to `“accuracy”` to allow the algorithm to automatically pick the best combination of `mtry` and `min_n` that maximized classification accuracy. Next, we fit the final training model using the full training set and the best combination of `mtry` and `min_n` and tested the model using the training set. To evaluate the efficacy of the model, we extracted the classification accuracy rate (0-1) and the AUC using the `collect_metrics()` function.
